		<h2>About the Artist</h2>
		<p>Kyrie shares a charming home in Logan, Utah with her husband and a cat called Fizz.
		When Kyrie is not toiling away at her craft, she can be found in her garden, watching 
		television with the cat, or repainting the upstairs bathroom, which changes color at 
		least semi-annually. Outside of her home, she can be found sheering sheep, 
		paddleboarding, and wandering the aisles of TJ Max in search of the newest pillow to 
		join her ever-growing collection.</p>
		
		<p>Kyrie enjoys just about every form of artistic expression, but is particularly fond 
		of printmaking, illustration, and needle felting. This site is specifically geared 
		towards her services as an illustrator. Kyrie currently exclusively uses watercolor 
		for her illustrations. If you are looking for a different medium, please feel free to 
		reach out and inquire. </p>
